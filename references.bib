	abstract = {What is the role of emotion in susceptibility to believing fake news? Prior work on the psychology of misinformation has focused primarily on the extent to which reason and deliberation hinder versus help the formation of accurate beliefs. Several studies have suggested that people who engage in more reasoning are less likely to fall for fake news. However, the role of reliance on emotion in belief in fake news remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, we explored the relationship between experiencing specific emotions and believing fake news (Study 1; N = 409). We found that across a wide range of specific emotions, heightened emotionality at the outset of the study was predictive of greater belief in fake (but not real) news posts. Then, in Study 2, we measured and manipulated reliance on emotion versus reason across four experiments (total N = 3884). We found both correlational and causal evidence that reliance on emotion increases belief in fake news: self-reported use of emotion was positively associated with belief in fake (but not real) news, and inducing reliance on emotion resulted in greater belief in fake (but not real) news stories compared to a control or to inducing reliance on reason. These results shed light on the unique role that emotional processing may play in susceptibility to fake news.},

	abstract = {"A revealing look at how user behavior is powering deep social divisions online--and how we might yet defeat political tribalism on social media. In an era of increasing social isolation, platforms like Facebook and Twitter are among the most important tools we have to understand each other. We use social media as a mirror to decipher our place in society but, as Chris Bail explains, it functions more like a prism that distorts our identities, empowers status-seeking extremists, and renders moderates all but invisible. Breaking the Social Media Prism challenges common myths about echo chambers, foreign misinformation campaigns, and radicalizing algorithms, revealing that the solution to political tribalism lies deep inside ourselves. Drawing on innovative online experiments and in-depth interviews with social media users from across the political spectrum, this book explains why stepping outside of our echo chambers can make us more polarized, not less. Bail takes you inside the minds of online extremists through vivid narratives that trace their lives on the platforms and off--detailing how they dominate public discourse at the expense of the moderate majority. Wherever you stand on the spectrum of user behavior and political opinion, he offers fresh solutions to counter political tribalism from the bottom up and the top down. He introduces new apps and bots to help readers avoid misperceptions and engage in better conversations with the other side. Finally, he explores what the virtual public square might look like if we could hit "reset" and redesign social media from scratch through a first-of-its-kind experiment on a new social media platform built for scientific research. Providing data-driven recommendations for strengthening our social media connections, Breaking the Social Media Prism shows how to combat online polarization without deleteing our accounts." --},

Chapter 4


Social media prism: distorts reality - we perceive only the attacks on our social identity, and miss the moderate voices, we do not find common ground, but get into a group competition


Story of boy summercamps with or without contact before divided into 2 competing groups


with contact, no in-outgroup dynamic


without contact, and with previous within-group contact/identity formation: conflict


Muzafer Sherif - 1973




in-group favorism is universal - 4


minimal groups- meaningless groups - 5


Liliana Mason: political parties are much more meaningful, professional campaigns, etc - animosity is not surprising


Common assumption in Western politics/philosophy that rational thinking produces better societies, finding common ground, hearing others arguments etc


Internet initially celebrated, democratic access to info, and discussion with others - public sphere




political identity can easily override rationality, even for nonpolitical issues


attractivity (25)




Quest for status


we have much bigger freedom in the choice of what to present and not present of ourselves online than offline


presenting different versions and adapting based on recognition by others


Groups give us self-esteem we cannot obtain on our own - 29




We choose social identities that make us feel good, what we realize others appreciate about us - feeling superior to others gives us a sense of self-worth. 




social identity definition by presenting ourselves in a particular way, showing certain behaviors, and avoiding behaviors that put us in danger of criticism (Bail?, spiral of silence, Lapowsky 2021)






Chapter 5: Extremists
Social media allows extremists to gain a sense of self-worth through status behaviors like aggressively defending their views in response to high-profile individuals from the other side, punching down on moderates in their own group, and


2 mechanisms of polarization/radicalization on social media: Normalizes extremism, makes the other side seem more extreme. 


Instagram study mentioned by Bail showing that only very few people become extremist as


a result of algorithms (below 2\%, maybe below 0.01\%)




Chapter 6: Moderates


Spiral of silence: Moderates start avoiding political topics on social media. They face high risks if they voice their opinion, “the stakes are too high”, getting attacked by extremists form the other and even their own side, Majority of people are afraid of posting stuff on social media of putting their opinion out there. They may agree with each other, be peaceful, etc., but this is not visible. 


Social status incentives are different for extremists and moderates (Chris Bail book)


This creates fake polarization - thinking the others are more extreme than they are, although there is overlap. This can create the impression of strong societal conflicts, even if only small groups of people disagree, it can create the impression of our world being full catastrophes, while these are just the only things you see


Chapter 7: Leaving social media and why it is so hard
Chapter 8 - Breaking the Prism


Fake polarization exists since the 1970ies, actual polarization has only increased since 1990,


Fake pol has increased since, social media strongly fuel it by mostly showing extreme voices


Believing others are much more different from us increases disliking them - affective polarization


3 ways/strategies:


become aware of the prism, check how extreme others are, realize they are extreme, and not the majority, don’t engage with them - or realize who they are and why they behave like this, instead engage in conversation with moderates


see yourself: where do you stand - if you are moderate, check if your online version represents who you are/what you believe, and what you might want to change about that


Break the prism




Breaking the prism


take small steps: find people with views not to distant from yours, and talk to them (Carolyn Sherif) - Ref 21


“Social Categorization as a Function of Latitude of Acceptance and Series Range.” (Bail, 2021, p. 198)


“Social Categorization.” For a more recent argument that parallels the concept of the latitude of acceptance, see Levendusky, “When Efforts to Depolarize the Electorate Fail.”” (Bail, 2021, p. 199)




Dorison, Minson, Rogers: listen to statements from opposing party - people overestimate the negative reaction they, and the other group, will have to statements opposing their respective view - it is not as bad as you think, willingness to listen increases


Similar study: Dorison Minson 29 - anger, frustration, anxiety


frame arguments in their values Miller and Feinberg


military service helps the poor catch up with the richer


homosexuality: framed in terms of patriotism and group loyalty - same sex couples are proud and patriotic Americans


could we make this an intervention? People are  not good at doing this (only 9-9\% can write convincing arguments for the opposing side), giving them suggestions based on algorithm detection?




Getting people to listen to each other, so they get better at understanding the other side - ref 27


Moderates less susceptible to fake polarization - 28


Talk about non-political issues - people prefer having kids who don’t, although they do not want their kids to marry someone from the other party - ref 31, 32


don’t start by asking why they voted for X




Be self-critical: Opinion leaders who resonate most with other side criticize their own party most often - ref 33 - survey of Twitter users

Prior studies indicate that high-arousal emotions may elicit rapid, intuitive thinking, tricking people into judging misinformation as truthful. Yet, few studies have distinguished prior affective state from emotional reactions to false news, both of which may influence belief in falsehoods in different ways. Replicating and extending Martel et al. (2020), we conducted a pre-registered online survey in Austria (N = 422), investigating associations of emotions and discernment of false and real news related to COVID-19. We found no associations of affective state with discernment, but different emotional responses to false and real news — namely, more anger and less joy for false news. A curvilinear relationship of anger with discernment showed that both participants who were good and bad at discerning real from false news responded with anger. The automated analysis of 5,613 open-ended textual responses suggested that anger may have arisen for different reasons in these different groups. It seemed to also arise when people recognized the false news as such, not only when people accepted it. We conclude that studies need to distinguish between prior affective state and emotional response to misinformation and consider individuals’ prior beliefs as determinants of emotions.},

Fourth, people do not believe everything they see on the internet: the sheer volume of engagement should not be conflated with belief. Fifth, people are more likely to be uninformed than misinformed; surveys overestimate misperceptions and say little about the causal influence of misinformation. Sixth, the influence of misinformation on people’s behavior is overblown as misinformation often “preaches to the choir.” To appropriately understand and fight misinformation, future research needs to address these challenges.},

The authors argue that emotions need to be viewed and researched as a system of systems. They give a brief review of systems meta-theory and try to map the three major attributes (multi-leveled, causally complex, and dynamic) onto common emotion theories.

Systems Meta-theory
1. Systems are multileveled= “According to the meta-theory there are multiple systems, at different levels of abstraction or of analysis, nested within a larger system.”


Macro-level systems


physical structures, natural and geographical boundaries, and political, economic, and other institutions (culture, structure, institutions)


emotion has been studied in macro-level systems by sociology and anthropology




Meso-level systems




bridges between macro and meso, depending on the context


smaller collectives, relationships, such as couple, family, co-workers


“meso-level emotional climate or feeling norm of the collective can influence how individual members experience and express emotion via shared appraisal or feeling, social contagion, and dyadic synchronization”

Micro-level systems


systems within the individual


these systems are the most frequently examined in work on emotion (psychology): perception, attention, memory, etc.


these work together in a system






-{\textgreater} these systems don’t just operate at different levels, they affect each other in complex and dynamic ways
2. Systems are complex= “Systems meta-theory assumes that systems at multiple levels operate together in a complex (rather than simple, unidirectional, linear, mechanistic) way. This complexity is achieved because the component parts of each of the relevant systems, and thus the overarching system, is “self-organizing”[..]. The parts combine to produce an invisible whole that works to do what cannot be done by the parts on their own”.


each system within a system is semi-autonomous


a system of systems is redundant, they can produce a phenomenon in multiple ways


structure and logic are less apparent, but the combination/product is clear



3. Systems are dynamic= “Systems meta-theory presumes that phenomena exist in non-equilibrium states that may appear stable but are always changing (even if only to maintain the status quo).”


dynamic in time, across persons, across contexts


change is often non-linear, and even chaotic


results in heterogeneous empirical observations which high levels of randomness


e.g., through fixed and random effects structures; especially when including non-linearity in their analysis





Emotion Systems


emotions experienced on the micro-level may be different depending on the meso- and macro-level; “emotion as rooted in interactions, relationships, and culture suggests that the social and psychological meaning most central to a particular emotion is variable”


emotion regulation research suggests a dynamic process by which individuals aim to alter what, where, and for how long they experience an emotion


emotion as an emergent phenomenon (Barrett’s constructionist theory): self-organized system that produces affect (on a physical level), then another cognitive system that helps understanding the meaning of the affective system


cognitive appraisal: emotion as a an emergent phenomenon produced by the interplay between numerous complex systems



Emotion in Socio-political Context


Social Identity Model of Collective Action (SIMCA): micro-level explanations tied to group biases: social identity as a member of a group that suffers societal injustice is a partial basis for displeasure at believing injustice and a sense of (political or group) efficacy -{\textgreater} unidirectional, but there are feedback loops, e.g., the individual motivation to protest -{\textgreater} feedback loops in a process are always a good sign that a systems approach is warranted (Fig. 3)


“Rather than assuming that emotion- and problem-focused coping are solely micro-level individual processes, the model presumes that social support from like-minded others (at the meso-level) can be an important basis for emotion and a sense of (collective, political) efficacy.” (Leach and Bou Zeineddine, 2021, p. 357)”


“Reinka and Leach (2018) analyzed their data with mixed-effects models that could distinguish the effects of stimuli, stimuli type, individual, and individual’s group in ways that helped to identify the system likely in play for each effect.” (Leach and Bou Zeineddine, 2021, p. 359)



“As it is not always possible to examine systems at very distant levels in a single study, a multi-method project can rely on common concepts from a more general theory embedded within a systems meta-theory.” (Leach and Bou Zeineddine, 2021, p. 359)

Conclusion
“In other words, systems meta-theory demands that work on emotion in a socio-political context theorizes explicitly and formally how systems of emotion and context combine to produce phenomena of interest.” (Leach and Bou Zeineddine, 2021, p. 359)


multi-leveled methods and statistics


dynamic study of phenomenon intensively over time as well as over people and contexts


multiple methods used together to provide a more complex combination of forms of empirical observation



data


big data, heterogeneous large-scale data from multiple levels


machine learning techniques \& complex methods relying on design sciences, experimental games and simulations


computational modeling to simulate the systems of interest: “computational modeling reinforces the system view that models are for continually estimating a range of probable trajectories that represent a best guess at any given moment.” (Leach and Bou Zeineddine, 2021, p. 360)




statistics


“a key statistical approach in systems research is the comparison of model fit, power, and robustness (to perturbations in the system)” (Leach and Bou Zeineddine, 2021, p. 360)

	abstract = {There is considerable concern about users posting misinformation and harmful language on social media. Substantial—yet largely distinct—bodies of research have studied these two kinds of problematic content. Here, we shed light on both research streams by examining the relationship between the sharing of misinformation and the use of harmful language. We do so by creating and analyzing a dataset of 8,687,758 posts from N = 6,832 Twitter (now called X) users, and a dataset of N = 14,617 true and false headlines from professional fact-checking websites. Our analyses reveal substantial positive associations between misinformation and harmful language. On average, Twitter posts containing links to lower-quality news outlets also contain more harmful language (β = 0.10); and false headlines contain more harmful language than true headlines (β = 0.19). Additionally, Twitter users who share links to lower-quality news sources also use more harmful language—even in non-news posts that are unrelated to (mis)information (β = 0.13). These consistent findings across different datasets and levels of analysis suggest that misinformation and harmful language are related in important ways, rather than being distinct phenomena. At the same, however, the strength of associations is not sufficiently high to make the presence of harmful language a useful diagnostic for information quality: most low-quality information does not contain harmful language, and a considerable fraction of high-quality information does contain harmful language. Overall, our results underscore important opportunities to integrate these largely disconnected strands of research and understand their psychological connections.},

	abstract = {According to the World Economic Forum, the diffusion of unsubstantiated rumors on online social media is one of the main threats for our society. The disintermediated paradigm of content production and consumption on online social media might foster the formation of homogeneous communities (echo-chambers) around specific worldviews. Such a scenario has been shown to be a vivid environment for the diffusion of false claim. Not rarely, viral phenomena trigger naive (and funny) social responses—e.g., the recent case of Jade Helm 15 where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of the civil war in the US. In this work, we address the emotional dynamics of collective debates around distinct kinds of information—i.e., science and conspiracy news—and inside and across their respective polarized communities. We find that for both kinds of content the longer the discussion the more the negativity of the sentiment. We show that comments on conspiracy posts tend to be more negative than on science posts. However, the more the engagement of users, the more they tend to negative commenting (both on science and conspiracy). Finally, zooming in at the interaction among polarized communities, we find a general negative pattern. As the number of comments increases—i.e., the discussion becomes longer—the sentiment of the post is more and more negative.},

Negative emotions are associated with information of all types that has high engagement
Sentiment analysis of Italian Facebook posts in specific homogeneous communities around the two topics science and conspiracy theories
- comments, posts and users of conspiracy pages tend to be much more negative than those of science pages
- when the discussion becomes longer, sentiment becomes more and more negative, both on science and conspiracy pages
- the higher the interaction with conspiracy theories, the more negative becomes the sentiment
- by focusing on polarized users (= the more active users), they identified an overall increase of the negativity of the sentiment
- sentiment is negative when polarized users interact with each other -{\textgreater} leading to an increase in comments -{\textgreater} increase in negativity and so forth
Main conclusion = "Our findings [...] make explicit that the longer the discussion the more negative the sentiment. In particular, discussions around conspiracy news degenerate faster than the scientific one."
Critique:
- operationalization of conspiracy theories and validation of science vs. conspiracy news
- aggregated average of the sentiment is negative, but maybe a huge share consists of positive emotions as well?

	abstract = {If popular online platforms systematically expose their users to partisan and unreliable news, they could potentially contribute to societal issues such as rising political polarization1,2. This concern is central to the ‘echo chamber’3–5 and ‘filter bubble’6,7 debates, which critique the roles that user choice and algorithmic curation play in guiding users to different online information sources8–10. These roles can be measured as exposure, defined as the URLs shown to users by online platforms, and engagement, defined as the URLs selected by users. However, owing to the challenges of obtaining ecologically valid exposure data—what real users were shown during their typical platform use—research in this vein typically relies on engagement data4,8,11–16 or estimates of hypothetical exposure17–23. Studies involving ecological exposure have therefore been rare, and largely limited to social media platforms7,24, leaving open questions about web search engines. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-wave study pairing surveys with ecologically valid measures of both exposure and engagement on Google Search during the 2018 and 2020 US elections. In both waves, we found more identity-congruent and unreliable news sources in participants’ engagement choices, both within Google Search and overall, than they were exposed to in their Google Search results. These results indicate that exposure to and engagement with partisan or unreliable news on Google Search are driven not primarily by algorithmic curation but by users’ own choices.},

This paper creates, validates, and compares the performance of (1) a novel emotional dictionary specifically for political text, (2) locally trained word embedding models combined with simple neural network classifiers, and (3) transformer-based models which overcome limitations of the dictionary approach. All tools can measure emotional appeals associated with eight discrete emotions. The different approaches are validated on different sets of crowd-coded sentences. Encouragingly, the results highlight the strengths of novel transformer-based models, which come with easily available pretrained language models. Furthermore, all customized approaches outperform widely used off-the-shelf dictionaries in measuring emotional language in German political discourse.},

After reviewing the conceptual and computational features of these methods, a new implementation of hurdle and zero-inflated regression models in the functions hurdle() and zeroinfl() from the package pscl is introduced. It re-uses design and functionality of the basic R functions just as the underlying conceptual tools extend the classical models. Both hurdle and zero-inflated model, are able to incorporate over-dispersion and excess zeros-two problems that typically occur in count data sets in economics and the social sciences-better than their classical counterparts. Using cross-section data on the demand for medical care, it is illustrated how the classical as well as the zero-augmented models can be fitted, inspected and tested in practice.},

	abstract = {Although published works rarely include causal estimates from more than a few model specifications, authors usually choose the presented estimates from numerous trial runs readers never see. Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is possible to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

	abstract = {How can citizens address hate in online discourse? We analyze a large corpus of more than 130,000 discussions on Twitter over four years. With the help of human annotators, language models and machine learning classifiers, we identify different dimensions of discourse that might be related to the probability of hate speech in subsequent tweets. We use a matching approach and longitudinal statistical analyses to discern the effectiveness of different counter speech strategies on the micro-level (individual tweet pairs), meso-level (discussion trees) and macro-level (days) of discourse. We find that expressing simple opinions, not necessarily supported by facts, but without insults, relates to the least hate in subsequent discussions. Sarcasm can be helpful as well, in particular in the presence of organized extreme groups. Mentioning either outgroups or ingroups is typically related to a deterioration of discourse. A pronounced emotional tone, either negative such as anger or fear, or positive such as enthusiasm and pride, also leads to worse discourse quality. We obtain similar results for other measures of quality of discourse beyond hate speech, including toxicity, extremity of speech, and the presence of extreme speakers. Going beyond one-shot analyses on smaller samples of discourse, our findings have implications for the successful management of online commons through collective civic moderation.},

In addition to the substantive topic of discussion, which corresponds to the different sections of the forum (such as Developers, Games, or Politics), we classify the threads according to structural features like the maximum number of comments at any level of the network (i.e. the width) and the number of nested layers in the network (i.e. the depth). We find that political discussion networks display a tendency to cluster around the area that corresponds to wider and deeper structures, showing a significant departure from the structure exhibited by other types of discussions.
